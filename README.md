## Case Study Description

#### Prompt

> Imagine - you wake up in the morning with an idea for a product that delivers daily weather reports to a mobile user’s inbox. You need to develop a landing page that users will be driven to via display and search advertisements. The objective of your landing page is to convert users who have clicked on your advertisements to opt into the usage of your product.

#### Objective

> Create a .NET based mobile landing page for your weather product that a user will be redirected to after clicking on an ad. Users driven to the page will need to enter a ZIP code, agree to legal provisions and terms, and then be allowed to download your product. Rather than simply explaining what the product is, and what it does, your page’s primary function is to convert as many user as possible into users of your product.

#### Requirements

- The landing page should be responsive: maintaining legibility and usability on a variety of mobile devices.

- ZIP code entry and acceptance of terms and conditions are mandatory.

- Track clicks on the install button to a database

- Because the page’s primary function is to convert as many users as possible into active users of your product, any design or functionality decisions should be made with optimal conversion rate being the end goal.
